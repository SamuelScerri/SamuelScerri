### Hi! Welcome to my silly profile! 👋
#### I like to experiment with many programming languages, and develop simple games using Unity and Godot. I also like to work on lower-level projects (which usually involves C)!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Custom Software Renderer written in ANSI C
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Multimedia Software Development at MCAST
- 📫 How to reach me: samuelscerri533@gmail.com
