### Hi! Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹
#### I like to experiment with many programming languages, and develop simple games using Unity and Godot. I also like to work on lower-level projects (which usually involves C, Go (and maybe a bit of Rust here and there))!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Multimedia Software Development at MCAST
